Here you can manually group an individual themed collection to "custom-collections" group by dusplicate template file and rename by system theme.

For example, in this theme, "auto-adventure" is made as an individual collection with logo etc, but if you duplicate "template.xml" and rename it
"auto-adventure.xml", at next loading or reboot this collection will be grouped with "custom-collections" group.
